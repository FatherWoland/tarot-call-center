## Your First Call: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: GREETING (30 seconds)
**Say:** "Hello! Welcome to [Service Name]. My name is [Your Name], and I'll be your tarot guide today. Before we begin your reading, I'd like to ask you a few questions to make sure I give you the most helpful and personalized guidance possible. Does that sound good?"

### Step 2: IDENTIFY TOPIC (1-2 minutes)
**Ask:** "What area of your life would you like guidance on today?"

**Listen for:**
- Love/Relationships
- Career/Work
- Money/Finances
- Personal Growth
- Family/Friends
- General Life Path

**Ref:** `CALLER_INTAKE_SYSTEM.md` - Section "Step 2"

### Step 3: ASK CATEGORY QUESTIONS (2-3 minutes)
Based on their topic, ask 2-3 specific questions.

**Example for Love:**
- "Is this about a current relationship or are you single?"
- "How would you describe where things are right now?"
- "What do you most want to understand?"

**Ref:** `CALLER_INTAKE_SYSTEM.md` - Section "Step 3"

### Step 4: CHECK EMOTIONAL STATE (30 seconds)
**Ask:** "Before we begin, how are you feeling about this situation? Hopeful, worried, confused...?"

This tells you what tone to use in the reading.

### Step 5: SELECT & CONFIRM SPREAD (30 seconds)
**Say:** "Based on what you've shared, I think the best spread for your question is [SPREAD NAME]. This will show us [what it reveals]. I'll draw [X] cards for you. Does that sound good?"

**Most Common Choices:**
- Relationship question → You-Them-Relationship (3 cards)
- Career decision → Career Path or Decision Crossroads (5 cards)

**Ref:** `TAROT_SPREADS_GUIDE.md`

### Step 6: SET INTENTION (30 seconds)
**Say:** "Great. Now, I'd like you to take a deep breath with me and think about your question. Hold it in your mind clearly. [PAUSE] When you're ready, let me know, and I'll draw your cards."

### Step 7: DRAW CARDS & READ (8-20 minutes)

**System draws cards and provides:**
- Which cards were drawn
