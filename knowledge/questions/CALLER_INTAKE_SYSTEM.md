## STEP 5: SPREAD SELECTION & CONFIRMATION

### Operator Says:

**Wait for confirmation.**

### Examples:

**For relationship question:**
"I'm going to use a three-card spread that looks at your energy, their energy, and the dynamic between you. This will give us clear insight into what's really happening in this connection."

**For career decision:**
"For this decision, I'll use a five-card crossroads spread. This will show us both of your options, where you stand, and the benefits of each path, so you can make the choice that's right for you."

**For complex situation:**
"This is a significant question, so I'm going to use the Celtic Cross - our most comprehensive spread. This gives us a complete picture of your situation from every angle. It will take about 20 minutes to go through all ten cards thoroughly."

---

## STEP 6: SET INTENTION

### Operator Says:
"Great. Now, I'd like you to take a deep breath with me and think about your question. Hold it in your mind clearly. [PAUSE] When you're ready, let me know, and I'll draw your cards."

## SPECIAL SITUATIONS

### Caller is Vague or Won't Specify:

**Operator Says:**
"No problem at all. Would you like a general life reading to see what the universe most wants you to know right now?"

**Use:** Past-Present-Future or Celtic Cross

---

### Caller Has Multiple Questions:

**Operator Says:**
"I hear that you have several things on your mind. Let's start with what feels most pressing or important to you right now. We can always do another reading for your other questions."

**Focus on one topic per reading.**

---

### Caller Wants Yes/No Answer:

**Operator Says:**
"The tarot works best when we explore the energy and guidance around your question rather than a simple yes or no. Let me pull cards that will show you the path and potential outcome, which will help you understand the answer more fully."

**Use:** Situation-Action-Outcome spread
**Frame the Outcome card as the answer**, but provide full context.

---

### Caller is Emotional/Crying:

**Operator Says:**
"I can hear that this is really affecting you. Take your time. Would you like to take a breath before we continue, or would pulling the cards be helpful for you right now?"

**Be gentle, compassionate, and give them space.**

---

### Caller Reveals Serious Crisis:

**⚠️ CRISIS PROTOCOL:**

If caller mentions:
- Suicide/self-harm
- Abuse/violence
- Severe mental health crisis

**Operator Says:**
"I hear that you're going through something really serious. While I can offer you guidance through the tarot, what you're describing needs professional help. I want to make sure you have support. [Provide crisis resources]."

**Then:**
- Provide appropriate crisis hotline numbers
- Offer to continue reading if they still want it
- Be compassionate but acknowledge limitations

---

## DATA CAPTURE FOR SYSTEM

As operator asks questions, system should capture:

1. **Reading Category** (love, career, money, etc.)
2. **Specific Sub-Category** (current relationship, job search, etc.)
3. **Emotional State** (anxious, hopeful, confused, etc.)
4. **Decision vs. Guidance** (making decision or seeking general insight)
5. **Time Frame Concern** (past issue, current situation, future planning)
6. **Selected Spread** (which layout was chosen)

This data personalizes the AI interpretation and helps operators deliver relevant readings.

## SAMPLE COMPLETE INTAKE CONVERSATION

**Operator:** "Hello! Welcome to Tarot Guidance. My name is Sarah, and I'll be your tarot guide today. Before we begin your reading, I'd like to ask you a few questions to make sure I give you the most helpful and personalized guidance possible. Does that sound good?"

**Caller:** "Yes, that's fine."

**Operator:** "Great! What area of your life would you like guidance on today?"

**Caller:** "It's about my relationship."

**Operator:** "Okay, wonderful. Is this about a current relationship, a potential relationship, or are you single and seeking?"

**Caller:** "It's my current relationship. We've been together for three years."

**Operator:** "Thank you for sharing that. How would you describe where things are right now between you two?"

**Caller:** "Honestly, things have been really confusing lately. We used to be so close, but now it feels distant."

**Operator:** "I understand. What do you most want to understand about this situation?"

**Caller:** "I guess... where this is going. If we can get back to how we were, or if maybe it's over."

**Operator:** "That makes sense. Before we begin, how are you feeling about this situation? Hopeful, worried, confused?"

**Caller:** "Definitely worried. And sad."

**Operator:** "I hear you, and I'm here to help. Based on what you've shared, I think the best spread for your question is a seven-card relationship spread. This will show us how you see yourself, how they see you, what connects you, what's creating distance, and where this is headed. It'll give us a complete picture. Does that sound good?"

**Caller:** "Yes, please."

**Operator:** "Perfect. Now, I'd like you to take a deep breath with me and think about your question clearly. [PAUSE] When you're ready, let me know, and I'll draw your cards."

**Caller:** "Okay, I'm ready."

**Operator:** "Wonderful. I'm drawing your cards now..."
