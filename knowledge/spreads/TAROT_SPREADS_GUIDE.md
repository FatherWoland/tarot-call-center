## How to Interpret Cards in Spreads

### Consider Context:
1. **Position Meaning** - What does this position represent?
2. **Card Meaning** - What does this card typically mean?
3. **Combined Interpretation** - How does the card's meaning apply to this position?

### Example:
- **Position**: Past (what led here)
- **Card Drawn**: The Tower
- **Interpretation**: "There was a sudden upheaval or dramatic change in your past that shattered old structures and brought you to this point. That disruption, while difficult, cleared the way for what you're experiencing now."

### Look for Patterns:
- **Multiple Major Arcana**: Significant, fated events beyond caller's control
- **Multiple Court Cards**: Other people heavily influencing situation
- **Suit Dominance**:
  - Lots of Wands = Action, passion-driven situation
  - Lots of Cups = Emotional, relationship-focused
  - Lots of Swords = Mental, communication, conflict
  - Lots of Pentacles = Material, practical, financial
- **Reversed Cards**: Blocked energy, internalized meaning, or opposite of upright

### Connect the Cards:
Don't read each card in isolation. Create a story that flows from one card to the next, showing how the situation evolves through the spread.
